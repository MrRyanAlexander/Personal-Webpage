# Ryan's Questions on AI and the Future

This is the codebase for my personal landing page, where I explore and ask questions about the impact of agents and AI on our communities, families, and individual lives.

The site serves as a platform to share my thoughts, "imaginations" (tiny tools and use cases born from these questions), and an open invitation for others to connect, challenge my thinking, and collaborate.

## About

I'm Ryan, and I build, break, and fix things. Lately, I've been particularly focused on understanding the real-world implications of AI beyond the headlines, especially as we move towards more advanced forms like ever-present AI (AGI).

This site is not a product pitch or a company website. It's a space for open inquiry and shared exploration of the complex questions surrounding AI's future.

## Project Structure

The project is a React application built with Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn UI.

Key directories and files:

*   `src/pages/Index.tsx`: The main landing page component.
*   `src/components/`: Contains reusable React components used throughout the site.
*   `src/components/ui/`: Contains Shadcn UI components.
*   `src/App.tsx`: Sets up the application's routing and context providers.
*   `index.html`: The main HTML file.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**


bash git clone <repository-url>

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**


bash cd <project-directory>

3.  **Install dependencies:**

4.  **Start the development server:**


bash npm run dev

The site should now be running at `http://localhost:9002` (or the port specified in the `npm run dev` command).

## Contributing

This project is primarily a personal reflection space, but I welcome contributions in the form of:
