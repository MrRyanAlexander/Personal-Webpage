          I'm not here to pitch a product. I don't think I know the future. But I am looking hard at what's happening and wondering:

          <li>What's actually working in enterprise?</li>

          <li>What might come next?</li>

          I've been sketching, testing, and prototyping different ideas. Tiny tools. Strange use cases. Radical helpers for real life.
          Here are a few:

          I'm sharing these not as polished solutions, but as open invitations. You might have a better idea. I hope you do.

          I don't want to work in isolation. I want to be wrong, early and often â€” and then make it better.
          So if you disagree, show me where.
          If you know how to make one of these ideas work better, I'm all ears.
          If you're building something similar, maybe we can help each other.
